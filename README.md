# CS2102 Backend

### Requirements

1. Install Postman
2. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`

### Quickstart

1. Download the queries [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e894694908db24d16c1f) for Postman.
2. `git clone` this repository
3. `cd cs2102-backend`
4. `docker-compose up` (with `sudo` if necessary)
5. Now, your backend and postgres server should be running on Docker.
6. For now, you can access the server by accessing `localhost:3000` and postgres by `localhost:9999`. In the future, direct access to postgres will be taken away.
